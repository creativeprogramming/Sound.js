Web Audio with (slightly) less confusion
---------------------------------------

Check out the demo [here](http://kevincennis.com/sound/)

####Featues:

- Uses <audio> elements instead of XHR to enable streaming and cross-domain loading. 
- Automaticallys create and connect analysers, compressors, reverbs, and gain nodes. Sensibly.
- Provides events for real-time metering
- Convolution effects.
- Dynamics compression. Don't abuse it.
- Tremolo.
- Fades.
- Free sandwiches.

Documentation is forthcoming, although the code is reasonably well-commented. 

This library is in its infancy. There are things that suck, and a lot of things missing. I'm hoping to change that. 

Any feedback or pull requests are enormously welcome. I'd love to see more developers working with the Web Audio APi.
