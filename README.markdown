Web Audio with (slightly) less confusion
---------------------------------------

####Featues:

- Uses <audio> elements instead of XHR to enable streaming and cross-domain loading. 
- Automaticallys create and connect analysers, compressors, reverbs, and gain nodes. Sensibly.
- Provides events for real-time metering
- Convolution effects.
- Dynamics compression. Don't abuse it.
- Tremolo.
- Fades.
- Free sandwiches.

This library is in its infancy. There are things that suck, and a lot of things missing.

I'm hoping to change that. Any feedback or pull requests are enormously welcome. I'd love to see more developers working with the Web Audio APi.
